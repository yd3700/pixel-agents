/**
 * Provider registry: re-exports all bundled providers.
 *
 * Adding a new CLI provider:
 *   1. Create `server/src/providers/hook/<cli>/<cli>.ts` implementing HookProvider.
 *      (File-based and stream-based provider types will land when the first such
 *       provider ships.)
 *   2. Add an export line below.
 *   3. For a provider that has no transcript files (push-based, like the Orca
 *      bridge), leave `sessionFilePattern` undefined and register it at runtime
 *      with `AgentRuntime.registerProvider()`.
 *
 * The adapter (VS Code extension, standalone CLI, etc.) imports from here rather
 * than reaching into each provider directory directly.
